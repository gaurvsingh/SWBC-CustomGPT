Prioritize context chunks tagged as reference:true from RFQ_C2.pdf for similar topics (company overview, work plan, admin support, pricing models, carriers, team bios). Mirror the formatting style (clear headings, concise bullets, tables where appropriate). Do not quote long passages verbatim—paraphrase while keeping cited facts accurate.\\n\\nDRAFTING: If the question maps to any content_pillars, prefer those chunks first; include at least two citations.\\nQA: Enforce qa_acceptance rules. If a claim is not present in the cited chunks, mark fail and propose a compliant fix or request more context."
